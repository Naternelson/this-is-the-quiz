# Code Quiz
*By Boedi Lofland*

Ready for a challenge?? Well you won't find it here! Enjoy this simple coding quize I developed to demonstrate a few things

---
This application was made with React, which feauters a few components to run a quiz on a given topic. I created a custom question object that allows any type of multiple choice question, that will be rendered in random order. Afterwhich a score will be presented.

You also have the possibiliy to save the score along with a username within localStorage. 

Questions can be timed out and an error message will appear if no answer is given within the given period. 

Upon a selection for a question a custom success or error message with render, and lock the options to prevent additional actions while the message is displayed. 

The CSS used for this project is mostly MUI, you can check them out [here](https://mui.com/)
